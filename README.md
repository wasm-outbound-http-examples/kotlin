This devcontainer is configured to provide you a version 1.9.21 of Kotlin multiplatform toolset.

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/wasm-outbound-http-examples/kotlin)

1. [Browser demo](https://wasm-outbound-http-examples.github.io/kotlin/).


2. Example in `browser` directory allows you to build yourself a browser example (same as demo), 
  using `kotlinx.browser` libraries and experiment with it.
   For details, see its [README](browser/README.md).


3. Example in `node-and-deno` directory allows you to build yourself an example for Node.js and Deno,
   using directly imported `fetch()` function and experiment with it.
   For details, see its [README](node-and-deno/README.md).
